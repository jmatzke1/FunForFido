This is the start of my enterprise java project

### Hi

- [ ] add project things from other folder and delete.
- [x] set up database with project
- [ ] set up all links to be correct, find out why openshift link does not work
- [ ] folder structure ? for servlets ?
- [ ] It is possible to bind and connect to localhost:8080 at the same time - 
    application server will probably compete with some other software on the port ( command to find this out ? )
