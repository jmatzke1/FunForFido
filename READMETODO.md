This is the start of my enterprise java project

### Hi


- [ ] It is possible to bind and connect to localhost:8080 at the same time - 
    application server will probably compete with some other software on the port ( command to find this out ? )
- [ ] Look into how authenication works, tie memebr id into username or list all info in member,
    can I copy from exercise ?

- [ ] figure out servlet parameters and pass them into map
