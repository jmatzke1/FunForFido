# Jason Matzke Individual Project
 
## Problem Statement

I want to make a website to find dog parks easier and be able to search for them, add your own pictures
from them and make comments. I will have the ability to add park you have been to or search for them
through a google map search. In the future, blog capabilities, photo albums and video addition will be added 
to the member services.
