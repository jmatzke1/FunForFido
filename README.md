## Problem Statement

I want to make a website that will accurately locate all dog park in an area and maybe provide directions from an address thta is listed. 
It will have users that can update conditions and daily ongoing events on a calendar. 
I am going to look for a way to pull information from many different sources. I may have to develop my own API to accomplish this.
