[Time log](https://github.com/jmatzke1/JasonMatzkeEnterpriseIndividualProject/blob/master/TimeLog.md)


#### Week 1 - 1/18 to 1/25

This week I installed all necessary programs for the class. I did some research and decided to go with a dog park locator as my project. I will use google maps and hopefully find more to use also. I looked at few similiar sites and noticed most are not accurate. This may leave it open to expand to all states in the future. I resolved a silly problem with IntelliJ not being able to find my catalina file and was an easy fix once I realized what I had (had to point it to the right file path)

#### Week 2 - 1/26 - 2/2

This week I got openshift up, finished up exercises. I had problems with openshift but ended up being a browser caching issue. I do need to learn more about logging and where to put it. Everything else seems to be going ok. Just need to stay ahead of the game.

#### Week 3 - 2/3 -2/9

Already not dong good staying ahead of the game. Busy weekend at work and struggling in a AJAX project put me behind here. Almost nothing done over the weekend. Will work to get ahead this week with mothing due in other classes for a few weeks.
